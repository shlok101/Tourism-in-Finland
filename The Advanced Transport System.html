	<h2>The Advanced Transport of Finland</h2>

	<h3>Finland's road system is utilized by most internal cargo and passenger traffic.

The main international passenger gateway is Helsinki Airport, which handled about 21 million passengers in 2019. Oulu Airport is the second largest with 1 million passengers in 2019, whilst another 25 airports have scheduled passenger services. The Helsinki Airport-based Finnair, Blue1, and Nordic Regional Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle sell air services both domestically and internationally.

<br>
<br>

Coming to trams and railway networks, Finland's first railway was opened in 1862, and today it forms part of the Finnish Main Line, which is more than 800 kilometers long. Helsinki opened the world's northernmost metro system in 1982.

<br>
<br>


The majority of international cargo shipments are handled at ports. Vuosaari Harbour in Helsinki is the largest container port in Finland; others include Kotka, Hamina, Hanko, Pori, Rauma, and Oulu. Helsinki and Turku have ferry connections to various parts of Finland. The Helsinki-Tallinn route is one of the busiest passenger sea routes in the world. By passenger counts, the Port of Helsinki is the third busiest port in the world. We can now get an idea of how advanced the transportation system of Finland is! </h1>
